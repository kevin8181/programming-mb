# `programming-mb`
Template repo for programming merit badge. Based on the 2025 requirements.

## About this repo
You will find 4 folders in this repo:

- project 1
- project 2
- project 3
- refactor

The three project folders are for you to put your three programs. Add the code for your programs into the respective folders. Then, edit the `README.md` file in each folder to describe your project. See the relevant requirement below:

> With your counselor's guidance, select three different programming languages and development environments. For each sub-requirement below, do the following: Write or modify a program using the indicated programming language and development environment. The program must take input and produce output based on computations and decisions made on the input. Debug and demonstrate the program to your counselor. Explain how each program processes inputs, makes decisions based on those inputs, and provides outputs based on computations and decision making.

The `refactor` folder is for the program you modified to add your own functionality. For convenience, you can use one of the sample programs in the folder. However, you are free to use another program from [www.scoutlife.org/programming](https://www.scoutlife.org/programming) or elsewhere. See the relevant requirement below:

> With your counselor's approval, choose a sample program. Modify the code or add a function or subroutine to it. Debug and demonstrate the modified program to your counselor. The Programming merit badge website, [www.scoutlife.org/programming](https://www.scoutlife.org/programming), has a number of sample programs that you could use for requirement 5. However, you have the option of finding a program on your own. It's a good idea to seek your counselor's guidance.
